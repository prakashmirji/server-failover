SetUp Requirements:

1. RHEL 7.x or CentOS 7.x server ( can be VM )
2. Python version 3.4 or above
3. download oneview python library from https://github.com/HewlettPackard/python-hpOneView and follow the steps 
   specified in https://github.com/HewlettPackard/python-hpOneView/blob/master/README.md
4. install following python modules 
	a. pika-0.10.0 to be installed on python https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pika
	b. library future-0.15.2, 
	c. setuptools-18.3.1
Notes:
	The future library can be downloaded at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/future
	The setuptools-18.3.1 library can be downloaded at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools/18.3.1

It is assumed that OneView 2.x is configured and it is managing c7000 and blades.

Business use case:

whenever server failures are detected - automatically create a new server from 
the resource pool without impacting the storage presented and OS installed.
	
The functionality of script:

The below script listens for server hardware critical and active alerts coming from HPE OneView.
When alert is recived by script, it creates a separate thread to handle the business logic and goes back
to listening mode to handle new alerts requests.

The thread invokes "create_server_profile_to_hardware.py" to provision a new server.
Script picks up the free available server from pool after validating with health rules.
Once healthy server is found, script unassigns profile from failed servers and assigns
newly identified healthy server. If profile create fails for some reason, scripts looks for
another healthy server. Script throws messages if no free available servers are available
in the pool. If all validations are passed, user should see server profile created on new
server. Server will have same MACs and WWNs. Server will be configured to boot from SAN so that
newly provisioned server will be booted with same OS as failed server.

Running the script:

Pre-requisite: set appliance ip, username and password in the profile_migration.py ( at the beginning of the file)

1. unzip the oneview_script.zip file
2. cd into oneview_script folder
3. run below command
  
  ./profile_migration.py

 
 Note: Script automatically manages certificates required for connecting to OneView Rabbit MQs.
 Following tasks are taken care. User doesn't need to do anything.
1. The script generates the certificate  to connect to oneview if it does not exists
2. The script download a copy of the SSL key and certificate. 

In the production, above script can be called from cron tab to start as a service running in the back ground.
