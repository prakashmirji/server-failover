The scripts demonstrate the functionality of connecting HPE OneView with
external applications.

In HPE OneView the State-Change Message Bus (SCMB) is an interface that uses
asynchronous messaging to notify subscribers of changes to managed resources,
both logical and physical. For example, you can program applications to receive
notifications when new server hardware is added to the managed environment or
when the health status of physical resources changes without having to
continuously poll the appliance for status using the REST APIs.

HPE OneView resources publish messages to the SCMB when they are created,
updated, or deleted. The message content is sent in JSON (JavaScript Object
Notation) format and includes the resource model. To view the list of HPE OneView
resources that publish messages, see the HPE OneView REST API Reference.

In order for the scripts to register and listen on the SCMB a couple
of thing need to happen first.

#1. The HPE OneView appliance needs to generate a Rabbit MQ keypair. This does
not happen by default and must be done ONE TIME for the running HPE OneView
appliance. If the scripts is run with the '-g' argument it will request that
the keypair is generated and exit. This only needs to be done
#1. Onetime for each HPE OneView appliance.

#2. The script needs to download a copy of the SSL key and certificate. If
 the example scripts is run with the '-d' option it will download the
required key and certificate. Again, this only needs to be done one time for the
script.

The below script generates, download the certificates and then monitors the alerts
received from HPE OneView's State-Change Message Bus. Specifically, the scmb alerts
raised for server profiles when they are at critical/warning state and is in ACTIVE mode.
This code then forks a thread to handle migration of server profile to another server hardware.

The forked script to create copy of server profile is termed create_server_profile_to_hardware.py,
Here server hardware's with no profile are fetched. This server hardware list is
then parsed to get a server hardware with good health and NIC status. A check is
further done to check if the hardware type matches that of server profile hardware
for which the alert was raised. The script then updates the server profile with the
new hardware details. A single profile update failure state is checked and the
process is repeated to ensure that we result in healthy server profile.


The profile_migrationy.py scrip can be invoked by:

  ./profile_migration.py -a [HPE OneView Appliance IP] -u Administrator -p MyPass
                           
                               or

  set appliance ip, username and password in the profile_migration parameters

  ./profile_migration.py
